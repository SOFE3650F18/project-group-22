## Step 2

### Iteration Goal

Our goal of this iteration is to *Choose a front end structure to serve our users* to complete QA-2. We have to make sure that our application is friendly enough to be used by the general population, as they will be spending time on the frontend of this application

## Step 3

### Elements to refine

For our goal, we will be refining is the CMS system

## Step 4

| Design Decisions and Location         | Rationale and Assumptions                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Create a Web application              | We decided that this would be best since users can access the CMS from any device                                                        |
| 3 Tier Framework                      | We will separate the client, server and database into three separate tiers                                                               |
| Use a MVC architecture design pattern | We decided that using the MVC will be useful since we can navigate the pages and update information whenever the server updates the view |

## Step 5

| Element            | Responsibilities                                                                   |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Presentation Layer | The layer the client will interact with                                            |
| UI                 | The set of components that will render the interface and control the flow of pages |
| Server             | Hosts the presentation layer, connects to the databse                              |
